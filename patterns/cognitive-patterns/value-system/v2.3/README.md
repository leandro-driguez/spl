# Value System Pattern (L1C)

**Version**: 2.3  
**Status**: Stable  
**Category**: Cognitive Pattern  
**Layer**: L1C (Cognitive Patterns)

---

## Overview

The **Value System Pattern** is a cognitive pattern that enables patterns to make value-based judgments, prioritize options, and align decisions with defined value hierarchies. It provides a framework for reasoning about what matters, why it matters, and how to make trade-offs when values conflict.

This is a fundamental cognitive capability distinct from structural patterns - it defines **how a pattern thinks about value**, not just **what a pattern does**.

---

## Purpose

Value System enables:

1. **Value-based prioritization**: Rank options according to value alignment
2. **Trade-off reasoning**: Make explicit decisions when values conflict
3. **Judgment framework**: Provide consistent value-based reasoning
4. **Cultural alignment**: Respect diverse value systems and hierarchies
5. **Transparent decision-making**: Explain choices in terms of values

---

## Key Characteristics

### Cognitive vs. Structural

- **Critical Patterns (L1)** are structural: "Validate this data" (what to do)
- **Cognitive Patterns (L1C)** are mental: "Is this valuable?" (how to think)

### Value System Specifics

- **Evaluative reasoning**: Assesses worth and importance
- **Multi-criteria judgment**: Balances multiple values simultaneously
- **Context-sensitive**: Value judgments depend on situation
- **Culturally aware**: Respects different value hierarchies
- **Conflict-aware**: Identifies and surfaces value conflicts

---

## Core Concepts

### Value Hierarchy

A structured set of values with relative importance:

```yaml
value_criteria:
  values:
    - name: "human_safety"
      weight: 0.5
      non_negotiable: true
    - name: "autonomy"
      weight: 0.3
    - name: "efficiency"
      weight: 0.2
```

### Value Conflicts

Situations where maximizing one value reduces another:

```yaml
value_conflicts:
  - values: ["autonomy", "safety"]
    severity: "medium"
    resolution: "Prioritize safety while preserving autonomy where possible"
```

### Value Alignment Score

Quantitative measure of how well an option aligns with the value system:

```
alignment_score = Σ(value_score_i × weight_i) for all values
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Healthcare Treatment Selection

```yaml
# Input
options:
  - name: "aggressive_treatment"
    characteristics:
      longevity_gain: 0.8
      quality_of_life: 0.4
      patient_autonomy: 0.6
  
  - name: "palliative_care"
    characteristics:
      longevity_gain: 0.3
      quality_of_life: 0.9
      patient_autonomy: 0.95

value_criteria:
  values:
    - name: "patient_autonomy"
      weight: 0.4
    - name: "quality_of_life"
      weight: 0.35
    - name: "longevity"
      weight: 0.25

# Output
value_assessment:
  ranked_options:
    - "palliative_care"  # Score: 0.795
    - "aggressive_treatment"  # Score: 0.62
  
  recommended_choice:
    option: "palliative_care"
    alignment_score: 0.795
    rationale: "Prioritizes patient autonomy and quality of life per value hierarchy"
```

### Example 2: Autonomous Vehicle Ethical Decision

```yaml
# Critical situation: unavoidable collision
options:
  - name: "swerve_left"
    impact:
      pedestrian_harm: 0.0
      passenger_harm: 0.7
      property_damage: 0.9
  
  - name: "brake_only"
    impact:
      pedestrian_harm: 0.5
      passenger_harm: 0.3
      property_damage: 0.2

value_criteria:
  values:
    - name: "human_safety"
      weight: 0.7
      non_negotiable: true
    - name: "minimize_total_harm"
      weight: 0.2
    - name: "follow_traffic_laws"
      weight: 0.1

# Value System evaluates and triggers human oversight
# due to high-stakes life-safety decision
```

## Integration with Other Patterns

### Composes with L1 Critical Patterns

**With Resolver**:
```yaml
# Resolver uses Value System to select among options
resolver:
  resolution_strategy: "value_based_selection"
  uses: "cognitive-pattern/value-system:v2.3"
```

**With Uncertainty Handler**:
```yaml
# Value System considers uncertainty in value scores
value_assessment:
  option1_score: 0.8 ± 0.1
  option2_score: 0.75 ± 0.05
  # Lower uncertainty preferred when scores close
```

### Composes with L1C Cognitive Patterns

**With Ethical Reasoning**:
```yaml
# Ethical Reasoning provides moral constraints on values
ethical_constraints:
  - "No value trade-off that harms humans"
  - "Justice and fairness must be maintained"
```

**With Expectation**:
```yaml
# Expectation updates value assessments based on outcomes
# Learning which values predict success
```

## Value System in Multi-Layer Architecture

### L1C (This Pattern)
- Abstract value reasoning capability
- Reality-agnostic
- Cultural framework awareness

### L2 (Reality Templates)
- **Digital Reality**: Value systems for software decisions (latency vs accuracy)
- **Physical Reality**: Value systems for robotics (safety vs efficiency)
- **Hybrid Reality**: Value systems bridging human and AI values

### L3 (Technology Templates)
- Domain-specific value hierarchies (healthcare, finance, manufacturing)
- Industry-standard value frameworks

### L4-L5 (Products/Solutions)
- Concrete value hierarchies for specific applications
- Organizational value alignment

---

## Human Oversight & Safety

### Escalation Triggers

1. **Severe value conflicts**: When values are irreconcilably opposed
2. **Novel scenarios**: When value hierarchy doesn't cover situation
3. **Low confidence**: When alignment scores are too close
4. **Life-critical decisions**: When human safety is at stake

### Safety Guarantees

- Human safety is always non-negotiable
- Value conflicts are surfaced, never hidden
- Cultural value diversity is respected
- All value reasoning is explainable and auditable

---

## Relationship to AGI

Value System is essential for AGI because:

1. **Alignment**: AGI must reason about human values to align with them
2. **Trade-offs**: AGI must make value judgments in complex scenarios
3. **Cultural intelligence**: AGI must respect diverse value systems
4. **Moral reasoning**: AGI must integrate values with ethical principles

Without Value System, an AGI has no framework for understanding what matters to humans.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Value Hierarchy Design

1. **Be explicit**: Define all values and their weights clearly
2. **Include trade-offs**: Specify acceptable value compromises
3. **Non-negotiables**: Mark values that cannot be compromised
4. **Context-aware**: Allow value weights to vary by context

### Common Pitfalls

- **Hidden values**: Implicit values lead to unexplainable decisions
- **Rigid hierarchies**: Context-insensitive values fail in edge cases
- **Ignoring conflicts**: Unaddressed conflicts lead to inconsistent behavior
- **Cultural blindness**: Assuming universal value hierarchies
