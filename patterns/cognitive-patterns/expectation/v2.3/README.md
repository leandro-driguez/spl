# Expectation Pattern (L1C)

**Version**: 2.3  
**Status**: Stable  
**Category**: Cognitive Pattern  
**Layer**: L1C (Cognitive Patterns)

---

## Overview

The **Expectation Pattern** is a cognitive pattern that enables prediction of future states, detection of surprises (prediction errors), and learning from the mismatch between expectations and reality.

This is **how a pattern anticipates the future**, not just how it reacts to the present.

---

## Purpose

Expectation enables:

1. **Prediction**: Anticipate future states and outcomes
2. **Surprise detection**: Identify when reality differs from prediction
3. **Anomaly detection**: Flag unusual or unexpected events
4. **Proactive behavior**: Act before events occur
5. **Model refinement**: Learn from prediction errors to improve accuracy

---

## Key Characteristics

### Prediction vs. Reaction

- **Without Expectation**: React to events as they happen
- **With Expectation**: Anticipate events and act proactively

### The Prediction Cycle

```
Current State → Generate Expectation → Observe Outcome → Compare → Update Model
      ↑                                                                    ↓
      └─────────────────── Improved Predictions ─────────────────────────┘
```

### Surprise as a Learning Signal

**Surprise** = |Expected - Observed|

- **No surprise** (0.0): Prediction was correct
- **Low surprise** (0.1-0.3): Minor deviation, within noise
- **Medium surprise** (0.4-0.6): Notable deviation, investigate
- **High surprise** (0.7-1.0): Major anomaly, alert human

## Core Concepts

### Expectation Structure

```yaml
expectation:
  predicted_state: "What will happen"
  confidence: 0.85  # How certain (0.0-1.0)
  uncertainty_sources:
    - "network latency variance"
    - "user behavior unpredictability"
  time_horizon: "next 5 minutes"
```

### Surprise Signal

```yaml
surprise_signal:
  expected: "task completes in 5 minutes"
  observed: "task completes in 12 minutes"
  surprise_level: 0.6  # Moderate surprise
  direction: "worse"  # Took longer than expected
  explanation: "database query slow due to unexpected load"
```

### Model Update

```yaml
model_update:
  before:
    task_duration_model: "mean=5min, stddev=1min"
  
  after_surprise:
    task_duration_model: "mean=6min, stddev=2min"  # Updated
    note: "Increased expected variance to account for load spikes"
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Predictive Maintenance

```yaml
# Manufacturing robot with sensors
current_state:
  machine: "robot_arm_7"
  sensors:
    temperature: 87°C  # Higher than normal
    vibration: 3.5mm/s  # Elevated
    operating_hours: 5200
  
historical_data:
  normal_temperature: "75-80°C"
  normal_vibration: "2.0-2.5mm/s"
  typical_failure_at: "6000 hours when temperature > 85°C"

# Generate expectation
expectation_analysis:
  prediction_model:
    pattern: "temperature + vibration trending toward failure threshold"
    historical_failures: 45  # Cases where this pattern led to failure
  
  expectation:
    predicted_state: "bearing failure"
    predicted_time: "within 48-72 hours"
    confidence: 0.86
    uncertainty_sources:
      - "load variance"
      - "maintenance quality"

# Proactive action
recommended_action:
  action: "schedule_maintenance"
  rationale: "High confidence prediction of imminent failure"
  urgency: "high"

# After 60 hours: Actual outcome
observed_outcome:
  event: "bearing failure occurred"
  time: 64 hours  # Within predicted range

surprise_analysis:
  surprise_level: 0.1  # Low surprise, prediction was accurate
  model_update: "reinforce current prediction model"
  confidence_boost: +0.02  # Model accuracy confirmed
```

### Example 2: Autonomous Vehicle Pedestrian Prediction

```yaml
# Car approaching crosswalk
current_state:
  vehicle:
    speed: 30 mph
    distance_to_crosswalk: 50 meters
  
  pedestrian:
    position: "sidewalk, 2 meters from curb"
    gaze_direction: "toward street"
    body_orientation: "facing crosswalk"
    traffic_signal: "pedestrian_walk_sign"

# Generate expectation
prediction_model:
  features:
    - "gaze toward street = 0.6 probability of crossing"
    - "walk signal active = 0.8 probability"
    - "body orientation = 0.7 probability"
  
  combined_probability: 0.88  # High likelihood of crossing

expectation:
  predicted_state: "pedestrian will cross in next 2-3 seconds"
  confidence: 0.88
  uncertainty: "pedestrian may wait for closer gap"

# Proactive action
vehicle_action:
  action: "slow_to_15mph"
  rationale: "High probability of pedestrian crossing"
  safety_margin: "prepare for full stop if needed"

# After 2.5 seconds: Actual outcome
observed_outcome:
  pedestrian_action: "crossed street"
  timing: 2.3 seconds

surprise_analysis:
  surprise_level: 0.05  # Very low, prediction accurate
  model_update: "reinforce gaze + signal prediction rule"

# Alternative outcome: Pedestrian doesn't cross
alternative_outcome:
  pedestrian_action: "remained on sidewalk"
  timing: "after 5 seconds, walk signal ended"

surprise_analysis_alternative:
  surprise_level: 0.4  # Moderate surprise
  explanation: "pedestrian saw vehicle approaching, waited"
  model_update: "add vehicle proximity as inhibiting factor"
  new_rule: "pedestrian less likely to cross if vehicle within 30m"
```

### Example 3: Network Performance Prediction

```yaml
# Cloud service predicting request latency
current_state:
  time: "14:00 (peak hours)"
  active_users: 15000
  server_load: 68%
  network_conditions: "normal"

# Historical pattern
historical_model:
  typical_latency_at_peak: "mean=120ms, 95th_percentile=200ms"
  confidence: 0.92  # Based on 6 months of data

# Expectation
expectation:
  predicted_latency: "100-150ms (median 120ms)"
  confidence: 0.92
  uncertainty_sources: ["sudden traffic spike", "server failure"]

# Actual outcome 1: Normal case
observed_latency: 125ms
surprise_level: 0.02  # Almost no surprise
action: "no model update needed"

# Actual outcome 2: Anomaly
observed_latency: 450ms  # Way higher than expected!
surprise_level: 0.85  # High surprise

surprise_investigation:
  root_cause_analysis:
    - "Check server health" → "All servers healthy"
    - "Check network" → "DDoS attack detected!"
    - "Check database" → "Normal"
  
  explanation: "DDoS attack caused unexpected latency spike"
  
  model_update:
    new_uncertainty_source: "DDoS attacks"
    new_monitoring: "Add DDoS detection to prediction inputs"
  
  human_alert:
    severity: "high"
    message: "Unexpected latency spike due to DDoS attack"
    action_taken: "Auto-scaling triggered, traffic filtering activated"
```

## Integration with Other Patterns

### With Knowledge Representation (L1C)

```yaml
# Knowledge structure informs predictions
knowledge_representation:
  provides: "Causal models and relationships"

expectation:
  uses: "Causal models to predict effects of actions"

example:
  knowledge: "rain → wet_roads → slower_traffic"
  prediction:
    if: "rain forecast"
    then: "expect traffic delays"
```

### With Experience Acquisition (L1C)

```yaml
# Learning improves predictions
experience_acquisition:
  learns: "Patterns from past outcomes"

expectation:
  uses: "Learned patterns to make better predictions"

workflow:
  1. Expectation: "Predict outcome"
  2. Observe: "Actual outcome"
  3. Experience Acquisition: "Learn from prediction error"
  4. Expectation: "Next prediction is more accurate"
```

### With Uncertainty Handler (L1)

```yaml
# Uncertainty quantification supports prediction
uncertainty_handler:
  quantifies: "Uncertainty in predictions"

expectation:
  uses: "Uncertainty estimates to set confidence levels"

example:
  prediction: "task completes in 5 minutes"
  uncertainty: "±2 minutes (95% confidence interval)"
  confidence: 0.85
```

### With Validator (L1)

```yaml
# Validation ensures predictions are sound
validator:
  checks: "Is prediction reasonable?"
  
expectation:
  prediction: "stock price will be $500 tomorrow"
  
validator:
  result: "INVALID - predicts 50% jump with no justification"
  action: "reject prediction, flag for review"
```

## Prediction Strategies

### Trend Extrapolation

Extend current trends into the future:
```yaml
strategy: "trend_extrapolation"
data: [100, 105, 110, 115, 120]  # Increasing trend
prediction: 125  # Next value
confidence: 0.8  # Assumes trend continues
```

### Pattern Matching

Find similar past situations:
```yaml
strategy: "pattern_matching"
current_state: "high load, peak hours, Tuesday"
similar_past_cases: ["last Tuesday peak", "2 weeks ago Tuesday"]
average_outcome: "latency = 130ms"
prediction: 130ms
confidence: 0.85
```

### Causal Modeling

Use causal relationships:
```yaml
strategy: "causal_modeling"
model: "if temperature > 85°C then failure_risk = high"
current_temperature: 87°C
prediction: "failure likely within 48 hours"
confidence: 0.86
```

### Ensemble Methods

Combine multiple prediction methods:
```yaml
strategy: "ensemble"
predictions:
  - {method: "trend", value: 125, weight: 0.3}
  - {method: "pattern", value: 130, weight: 0.4}
  - {method: "causal", value: 128, weight: 0.3}

final_prediction: 128  # Weighted average
confidence: 0.88  # Higher confidence from consensus
```

---

## Handling Surprise

### Surprise Levels

```yaml
surprise_levels:
  none: 0.0-0.1      # Prediction accurate
  low: 0.1-0.3       # Minor deviation
  medium: 0.3-0.6    # Notable difference
  high: 0.6-0.85     # Major anomaly
  extreme: 0.85-1.0  # Completely unexpected
```

### Response to Surprise

**Low Surprise**: Normal variance, no action needed
```yaml
surprise: 0.2
response: "within expected range, continue"
```

**Medium Surprise**: Investigate and learn
```yaml
surprise: 0.5
response:
  - "Analyze why prediction was off"
  - "Update model if systematic error"
  - "Increase uncertainty if variance underestimated"
```

**High Surprise**: Alert and investigate urgently
```yaml
surprise: 0.8
response:
  - "Immediate investigation"
  - "Alert human operators"
  - "Check for anomalies or attacks"
  - "Consider safety implications"
```

---

## Safety and Human Oversight

### Critical Domain Predictions

Extra caution in high-stakes areas:
```yaml
critical_domains: ["medical", "safety", "financial"]

safety_rules:
  - "Low confidence (< 0.7) → require human review"
  - "High surprise (> 0.7) → immediate human alert"
  - "Novel situation → flag uncertainty"
```

### Black Swan Events

Rare, high-impact events:
```yaml
black_swan_handling:
  definition: "low probability, extreme impact"
  
  approach:
    - "Don't ignore just because probability is low"
    - "Model potential impact even if unlikely"
    - "Prepare contingencies for tail risks"
  
  example:
    event: "pandemic shuts down economy"
    probability: 0.001  # Very low
    impact: "catastrophic"
    action: "Include in risk planning despite low probability"
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overconfidence**: Predictions too certain
   - **Solution**: Calibrate confidence with actual accuracy

2. **Ignoring outliers**: Dismissing rare events
   - **Solution**: Consider low-probability high-impact scenarios

3. **No model updates**: Predictions don't improve
   - **Solution**: Learn from every prediction error

4. **Confirmation bias**: Only noticing predictions that confirm beliefs
   - **Solution**: Track all predictions and outcomes objectively

5. **Extrapolation beyond data**: Predicting in novel situations
   - **Solution**: Flag low confidence when outside training distribution

---

## Relationship to AGI

Expectation is critical for AGI:

1. **Proactive behavior**: AGI must anticipate, not just react
2. **Curiosity**: Surprise drives exploration (high surprise = interesting)
3. **Continual learning**: Prediction errors fuel learning
4. **Planning**: Predicting action outcomes enables effective planning

Without Expectation, AGI cannot plan ahead or learn from experience effectively.
