# Knowledge Representation Pattern (L1C)

**Version**: 2.3  
**Status**: Stable  
**Category**: Cognitive Pattern  
**Layer**: L1C (Cognitive Patterns)

---

## Overview

The **Knowledge Representation Pattern** is a cognitive pattern that enables patterns to organize, structure, and access knowledge in meaningful ways. It provides frameworks for representing what is known, how concepts relate, and what can be inferred.

This is **how a pattern thinks about knowledge structure**, not just how it stores data.

---

## Purpose

Knowledge Representation enables:

1. **Structured knowledge**: Organize information in reasoning-compatible formats
2. **Semantic relationships**: Capture meaningful connections between concepts
3. **Inference support**: Enable logical reasoning over knowledge
4. **Knowledge integration**: Combine knowledge from multiple sources
5. **Gap identification**: Detect what is not known

---

## Key Characteristics

### Knowledge vs. Data

- **Data**: Raw facts (e.g., "Patient temperature: 38.5°C")
- **Information**: Processed data (e.g., "Patient has fever")
- **Knowledge**: Structured understanding (e.g., "Fever → possible infection → requires diagnosis")

### Representation Schemas

**Ontologies**: Formal conceptual frameworks
```yaml
ontology:
  Disease:
    is_a: "MedicalCondition"
    has_symptom: "Symptom"
    treated_by: "Treatment"
```

**Semantic Networks**: Graph-based representations
```
COVID-19 --is_a--> ViralInfection --causes--> Fever
      |
      |--has_symptom--> Cough
      |
      |--treated_by--> Antiviral
```

**Frames**: Slot-based structures
```yaml
Disease Frame:
  name: "COVID-19"
  type: "ViralInfection"
  symptoms: ["fever", "cough", "fatigue"]
  transmission: "respiratory_droplets"
```

---

## Core Concepts

### Concepts and Entities

Basic units of knowledge:
```yaml
concept:
  id: "covid_19"
  type: "Disease"
  properties:
    name: "COVID-19"
    pathogen: "SARS-CoV-2"
    severity: "moderate_to_severe"
```

### Relationships

Connections between concepts:
```yaml
relationships:
  - type: "is_a"
    source: "covid_19"
    target: "viral_infection"
  
  - type: "has_symptom"
    source: "covid_19"
    target: "fever"
    confidence: 0.85
```

### Hierarchies and Taxonomies

Structured classification:
```
MedicalCondition
├── Infection
│   ├── ViralInfection
│   │   ├── COVID-19
│   │   └── Influenza
│   └── BacterialInfection
└── Chronic Condition
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Medical Diagnosis Knowledge

```yaml
# Input: Raw medical information
raw_information:
  patient_symptoms: ["fever", "dry_cough", "fatigue"]
  lab_results:
    - test: "PCR"
      result: "positive"
      pathogen: "SARS-CoV-2"
  patient_history:
    - "recent_travel"
    - "contact_with_infected_person"

representation_schema:
  ontology:
    Disease:
      properties: ["name", "pathogen", "severity"]
      relationships: ["has_symptom", "diagnosed_by", "risk_factor"]
    Symptom:
      properties: ["name", "severity", "onset"]
    Test:
      properties: ["name", "specificity", "sensitivity"]

# Output: Structured knowledge
knowledge_structure:
  concepts:
    - id: "covid_19"
      type: "Disease"
      properties:
        name: "COVID-19"
        pathogen: "SARS-CoV-2"
        severity: "confirmed"
  
  relationships:
    - type: "has_symptom"
      source: "covid_19"
      target: "fever"
      evidence: "patient_report"
    
    - type: "diagnosed_by"
      source: "covid_19"
      target: "pcr_test"
      confidence: 0.99
    
    - type: "risk_factor"
      source: "recent_travel"
      target: "covid_19"
      strength: "high"
  
  inference_paths:
    - path: ["fever", "indicates", "infection", "confirmed_by", "pcr_test"]
      conclusion: "COVID-19 diagnosis"
      confidence: 0.95
```

### Example 2: Manufacturing Process Knowledge

```yaml
# Represent production workflow knowledge
raw_information:
  processes:
    - name: "cutting"
      inputs: ["raw_material"]
      outputs: ["cut_parts"]
      duration: "10 min"
    
    - name: "assembly"
      inputs: ["cut_parts", "fasteners"]
      outputs: ["assembled_product"]
      duration: "20 min"
      requires: "cutting"  # Dependency

representation_schema:
  ontology:
    Process:
      properties: ["duration", "resources"]
      relationships: ["requires", "produces", "uses"]
    Resource:
      properties: ["type", "quantity", "availability"]

knowledge_structure:
  concepts:
    - id: "cutting_process"
      type: "Process"
      properties:
        duration: 10
        resources: ["cutting_machine"]
  
  relationships:
    - type: "requires"
      source: "assembly_process"
      target: "cutting_process"
      constraint: "temporal_precedence"
    
    - type: "produces"
      source: "cutting_process"
      target: "cut_parts"
      quantity: "per specification"
  
  inference_paths:
    - path: ["assembly", "requires", "cutting", "requires", "raw_material"]
      conclusion: "Raw material needed for assembly"
```

## Integration with Other Patterns

### With Critical Patterns (L1)

**With Validator**:
```yaml
# Validate knowledge consistency
validator:
  validates: "knowledge_structure"
  checks:
    - "No contradictory relationships"
    - "All concepts properly typed"
    - "Ontology constraints satisfied"
```

**With Translator**:
```yaml
# Translate between knowledge representations
translator:
  source: "semantic_network"
  target: "frame_based"
  preserves: "semantic_equivalence"
```

### With Cognitive Patterns (L1C)

**With Experience Acquisition**:
```yaml
# Learn new knowledge from experience
experience_acquisition:
  observes: "patient_outcomes"
  updates: "treatment_knowledge"
  method: "incremental_learning"
```

**With Expectation**:
```yaml
# Use knowledge to generate expectations
expectation:
  uses: "disease_progression_knowledge"
  predicts: "symptom_timeline"
```

## Knowledge Representation Formats

### Graph-Based (Knowledge Graphs)

Best for: Complex relationships, semantic search

```yaml
format: "knowledge_graph"
structure:
  nodes: "concepts"
  edges: "relationships"
  properties: "on both nodes and edges"
```

### Hierarchical (Ontologies)

Best for: Classification, inheritance

```yaml
format: "ontology"
structure:
  classes: "concept types"
  properties: "attributes"
  restrictions: "constraints"
```

### Frame-Based

Best for: Structured entities with slots

```yaml
format: "frames"
structure:
  frame_type: "template"
  slots: "attributes with constraints"
  defaults: "default values"
```

### Logic-Based (First-Order Logic, Description Logic)

Best for: Formal reasoning, proofs

```yaml
format: "description_logic"
structure:
  axioms: "logical statements"
  concepts: "defined by logic"
  inference: "automatic reasoning"
```

---

## Handling Knowledge Gaps

### Types of Gaps

1. **Missing Concepts**: Entity not in ontology
2. **Missing Relationships**: Connection between known concepts unknown
3. **Incomplete Definitions**: Concept lacks key properties
4. **Contradictions**: Inconsistent information

### Gap Detection

```yaml
knowledge_gaps:
  - type: "missing_relationship"
    description: "No known relationship between Disease X and Treatment Y"
    severity: "high"
    suggested_action: "Consult medical literature"
  
  - type: "incomplete_definition"
    description: "Drug Z lacks side effect information"
    severity: "medium"
    suggested_action: "Query drug database"
```

---

## Human Oversight & Safety

### When to Escalate

1. **High inconsistency**: Contradictory knowledge from reliable sources
2. **Novel concepts**: Entities not in existing ontology
3. **Critical domains**: Medical, safety-critical knowledge
4. **Low confidence**: Uncertain knowledge affecting decisions

### Knowledge Provenance

Always track:
```yaml
metadata:
  source: "Medical Journal XYZ, 2024"
  confidence: 0.92
  last_verified: "2025-10-20"
  expert_reviewed: true
  citations: ["doi:10.1234/5678"]
```

## Relationship to AGI

Knowledge Representation is critical for AGI:

1. **World model**: AGI needs structured understanding of the world
2. **Transfer learning**: Structured knowledge enables cross-domain reasoning
3. **Explainability**: Structured knowledge supports explanation generation
4. **Continuous learning**: Knowledge representation evolves with new information

Without Knowledge Representation, AGI cannot integrate information into coherent understanding.

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-structuring**: Too rigid schemas that can't adapt
2. **Under-structuring**: Too loose, doesn't support reasoning
3. **Ignoring provenance**: Unknown source credibility
4. **Static representations**: Not updating with new knowledge
5. **Domain blindness**: Applying wrong ontology to domain
